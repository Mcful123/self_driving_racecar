Special instructions for running our controller: We have installed scipy as an additional library. 

When pulling our git repo, please pull both agent.py AND map.csv. If map.csv is missing, the first run of our controller will be generating the track map. 

All consecutive runs of our agent.py will use the generated map.csv and can detect obstacles/scenarios.

Please also test with --sync enabled. Thanks!
